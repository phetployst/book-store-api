# üìö Book Store API

An API for managing a bookstore, built with Go and the Echo framework. This project allows users to browse, create, update, and delete book records.

This project is based on the [example-go-api](https://github.com/raksit31667/example-go-api) repository. Many concepts and structures were adapted and built upon from this source.
