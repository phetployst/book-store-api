# üìö Book Store API

An API for managing a bookstore, built with Go and the Echo framework. This project allows users to browse, create, update, and delete book records, while providing efficient handling of ISBN validation and error handling.

This project is based on the [example-go-api](https://github.com/raksit31667/example-go-api) repository. Many concepts and structures were adapted and built upon from this source.

## üìù Features

- Add, update, and delete books
- ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 validation
- Middleware for logging with request tracing (parent & span IDs)
- Error handling and proper logging
- Mock testing and CI/CD integration
